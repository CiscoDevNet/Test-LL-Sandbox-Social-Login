## Objective ##

Completion Time: 1 minutes

* Test DevNet Social Login
* Use the link below to take you directly to a test instance of the Sandbox
* Since you are reading this page, we will assume that you have already authenticated to Learning Labs using your Cisco ID or Social Login
* If Social Login has wokred correctly you should be able to click the link below which will take you to a test instance of the Sandbox without reauthentication


## Step 1. Click on the link below

Ok, here's the deal.  We need to test to make sure that once you've logged into learning labs using either your Cisco ID or any Social Login, that you **don't** have to reauthenticate when you click a link that takes you to the Sandbox

The link below is to a Test Instance of Sandbox (CloudShell) where Social Login is already enabled. This will **not** take you to the production instance of Sandbox.



Ok, here's your link: [Social Login Enabled Sandbox/CloudShell Server](https://devnetsandboxtest.cisco.com)
